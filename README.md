## Local Deployment

1. Clone the project locally or download the project code zip.

2. Install Docker, select the corresponding operating system type and download and install it.

3. Under the file address of the corresponding project, run the command:

```
docker compose up
```
> Note: The initial installation may take some time, so please be patient and make sure you have a good internet connection.

4. Open a browser and access Localhost:9001.
> username: user password: password

5. Modify the Access key to:
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID = MekKrisWUnFFtsEk
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET = XK4uxD1czzYFJCRTcM70jVrchccBdy6C

6. Open your browser and visit the following address to access it:

    http://localhost:8086/supplier Labeling

    http://localhost:8086/operator admin

> Replace localhost with the corresponding ip address to share it with other team members so that they can use it directly without repeated deployment.
